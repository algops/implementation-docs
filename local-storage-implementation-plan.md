# Local Storage Implementation Plan

## **Current Local Storage Infrastructure Analysis**

### **1. Existing LocalStorageManager System**

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **Singleton Pattern**: `LocalStorageManager` class with single instance access
- **Prefix System**: All keys prefixed with `"algops_"` for namespace isolation
- **Type Safety**: Generic `StorageItem<T>` interface with timestamp and version support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with console error logging
- **SSR Safety**: All operations check `typeof window === "undefined"` for server-side rendering

**Current Storage Functions:**
- **Generic Operations**: `setItem()`, `getItem()`, `removeItem()`, `getAllKeys()`, `clear()`
- **Data-Specific Functions**: 
  - `saveSourceData()` / `getSourceData()` - Source management
  - `saveWorkflowData()` / `getWorkflowData()` - Workflow management  
  - `saveActivityData()` / `getActivityData()` - Activity management
  - `saveDashboardData()` / `getDashboardData()` - Dashboard state

### **2. Recent Items System**

**Current Implementation:**
- **Direct localStorage Access**: Uses `localStorage.getItem("recentItems")` directly (not through LocalStorageManager)
- **Custom Event System**: Dispatches `"recentItemsUpdated"` events for real-time UI updates
- **Deduplication Logic**: Removes duplicate URLs, maintains chronological order
- **Size Limiting**: Maximum 3 recent items with automatic cleanup
- **Data Structure**: Simple array of `{name, url, icon?}` objects

**Usage Pattern:**
- **Navigation Tracking**: Automatically adds items when users visit pages
- **Breadcrumb Integration**: Powers navigation breadcrumbs and recent page access
- **Cross-Component Communication**: Uses custom events for real-time updates

### **3. Form Auto-Save System**

**Current Implementation:**
- **Auto-Save Hook**: `useAutoSave()` hook in `auto-save-form.tsx`
- **Interval-Based Saving**: Configurable save intervals (default 5 seconds)
- **Form-Specific Keys**: Uses `form_${formId}` pattern for unique form identification
- **BeforeUnload Protection**: Saves data when user leaves page
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for save success/failure
- **Storage Integration**: Uses LocalStorageManager for consistent data handling

**Current Usage:**
- **Form Persistence**: Saves form data automatically during user input
- **Recovery System**: Loads saved data when user returns to form
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user notifications

### **4. Table State Persistence**

**Current Implementation:**
- **Direct localStorage Access**: Uses `localStorage.getItem("table-state-${tableId}")` directly
- **State Serialization**: Saves complete table state including filters, sorting, pagination
- **Automatic Loading**: Restores state on component mount
- **Configurable Persistence**: Optional feature controlled by `persistState` prop

## **Current Codebase Structure Analysis**

## **Phase 8: Form Isolation and Pattern Unification**

### **Critical Issue: Multiple Forms on Same Page**

**Problem Context:**
When multiple RequestMetadataForm instances exist on the same page (for example, in forms showcase with RunRequestForm, DeliveryForm, and StatusCheckForm all displayed simultaneously), selecting an option in any form's request-metadata section redirects focus to the input field in the first form instance on the page. Additionally, when the same page is open in multiple browser tabs, there are potential conflicts in localStorage keys and no isolation between tab instances.

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. **Global DOM Queries**: RequestMetadataForm uses `document.querySelector()` which searches the entire document and always returns the first matching element, regardless of which component instance triggered the action.

2. **Non-Unique Data Attributes**: All RequestMetadataForm instances use identical `data-metadata="url"` and `data-header-id` attributes without any instance-level namespacing.

3. **Weak ID Generation**: Header IDs are generated using `Date.now().toString()` which can create collisions when multiple forms render simultaneously or users click "Add Header" within the same millisecond.

4. **Hardcoded Initial IDs**: All forms start with a header that has `id: "1"`, creating duplicate IDs across multiple form instances until user interaction occurs.

5. **No Form Instance Identifier**: Components lack unique instance identifiers to namespace their elements and distinguish themselves from other instances.

6. **No Tab Isolation**: Auto-save functionality uses `form_${formId}` keys without tab-specific identifiers, causing conflicts when the same form is open in multiple browser tabs.

7. **Inconsistent localStorage Access**: Sixty percent of direct localStorage access bypasses the LocalStorageManager, leading to inconsistent prefixing, error handling, and lack of centralized control.

### **Pattern Analysis Across Codebase**

**Current ID Generation Patterns:**

**Pattern One - React.useId()**: 
- Location: chart.tsx line 46, form.tsx line 79
- Use Case: Component instance identification for accessibility and DOM relationships
- Characteristics: React-native, SSR-safe, guaranteed unique per component instance
- Format: Returns colon-separated string like `:r1:` that needs sanitization for use in data attributes
- Current Usage: Chart component creates `chart-${id || uniqueId.replace(/:/g, "")}` for clean attribute values
- Recommendation: Use for all component-level instance identification

**Pattern Two - Date.now() Only**:
- Location: request-metadata.tsx lines 82, 97, and initial header line 45
- Use Case: Runtime header ID generation
- Characteristics: Timestamp in milliseconds, no uniqueness guarantee
- Problem: Collision risk when operations happen in same millisecond
- Recommendation: Replace with Pattern Three

**Pattern Three - Date.now() + Math.random()**:
- Location: source-body-upload.tsx line 103
- Format: `Date.now()-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`
- Use Case: File upload IDs and runtime unique identifiers
- Characteristics: Timestamp plus random alphanumeric suffix, excellent uniqueness
- Current Usage: File management system for uploaded JSON files
- Recommendation: Standard for all runtime ID generation

**Pattern Four - Counter-Based genId()**:
- Location: use-toast.ts lines 28-33
- Use Case: Sequential toast notification IDs
- Characteristics: Simple counter modulo MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
- Intentional Design: Sequential IDs appropriate for notification ordering
- Recommendation: Keep as-is, do not change (pattern serves specific purpose)

**Pattern Five - nanoid Package**:
- Location: package.json dependencies
- Current Status: Available but completely unused in UI code
- Recommendation: Do not introduce, existing patterns are sufficient

**Current LocalStorage Access Patterns:**

**Pattern One - LocalStorageManager (Preferred)**:
- Location: utils/local-storage.ts
- Features: Prefix system with `algops_`, error handling, type safety, timestamp tracking, version support
- Current Usage: auto-save-form.tsx uses `storage.setItem()`
- Characteristics: Singleton pattern, comprehensive error handling, SSR-safe checks
- Problem: Only forty percent adoption across codebase

**Pattern Two - Direct localStorage with Prefix**:
- Location: recent-items.ts
- Format: Hardcoded `algops_recent_items` key
- Problem: Duplicates prefix logic, bypasses centralized management
- Missing: Timestamp tracking, version support, centralized error handling

**Pattern Three - Direct localStorage without Prefix**:
- Location: base-selector.tsx line 188, use-table-state.ts lines 38 and 65
- Format: Raw keys like `${storageKey}` or `table-state-${tableId}`
- Problem: No namespace isolation, potential key collisions with other applications
- Missing: All benefits of LocalStorageManager

**Pattern Four - Mixed Approach**:
- Location: auto-save-form.tsx
- Uses LocalStorageManager but implements custom key pattern `form_${formId}`
- Problem: No tab isolation, conflicts across browser tabs

**Current DOM Query Patterns:**

**Pattern One - Global Document Queries (Problematic)**:
- Location: request-metadata.tsx lines 130, 141
- Scope: Entire document
- Problem: Cannot distinguish between multiple component instances
- Current Usage: Only file using this anti-pattern

**Pattern Two - Ref-Based Component Scoping (Standard)**:
- Location: short-text-input.tsx, json-explorer.tsx, base-hovercard.tsx
- Pattern: `const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)` then `inputRef.current.focus()`
- Scope: Component instance only
- Characteristics: Type-safe, instance-isolated, follows React best practices
- Current Usage: One hundred percent of components except request-metadata

**Pattern Three - Container Ref with querySelector (Advanced)**:
- Location: json-explorer.tsx lines 109-110
- Pattern: `const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)` then `containerRef.current?.querySelector()`
- Scope: Component subtree only
- Use Case: When querying child elements within component
- Characteristics: Scoped queries, null-safe with optional chaining

**Current Data Attribute Patterns:**

**Pattern One - Dynamic Namespaced (Correct)**:
- Location: chart.tsx line 52
- Format: `data-chart={chartId}` where chartId includes unique instance ID
- Usage: Enables scoped CSS and queries without collisions
- Characteristics: Instance-specific, collision-free

**Pattern Two - Static Non-Namespaced (Problematic)**:
- Location: request-metadata.tsx line 164
- Format: `data-metadata="url"` identical across all instances
- Problem: Indistinguishable between component instances

**Pattern Three - Dynamic Non-Namespaced (Partial)**:
- Location: request-metadata.tsx line 180
- Format: `data-header-id={header.id}` varies per header but not per component
- Problem: Header IDs could collide between different form instances

### **Comprehensive Solution Architecture**

### **1. RequestMetadataForm Component Isolation**

**File Location**: `/components/forms/blocks/request-metadata.tsx`

**Component Instance Identification:**

Add React.useId() hook at component initialization to generate unique instance identifier. Store in constant named `instanceId`. The raw React ID contains colons which are invalid in CSS selectors and data attributes, so create sanitized version by replacing all colons with empty string, stored in constant named `cleanId`. This approach follows the exact pattern established in chart.tsx line 47 where chart ID is constructed as `chart-${id || uniqueId.replace(/:/g, "")}`.

Optionally accept `instanceId` prop to allow parent components to provide explicit instance identifiers for specific use cases. If prop is provided, use it directly; otherwise use the generated React ID. This enables both automatic instance isolation and manual control when needed.

**Container Reference for Scoped Queries:**

Create container ref using `useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)` at component top level. This ref will point to the root element of the component and enable all DOM queries to be scoped to this specific component instance rather than the entire document.

Wrap the entire component return JSX in a div element with the ref attached. This div becomes the query scope boundary. All querySelector operations will use `containerRef.current?.querySelector()` pattern instead of `document.querySelector()`.

**Data Attribute Namespacing:**

Current `data-metadata="url"` attribute on line 164 must become `data-metadata={cleanId}` to namespace with instance identifier. This ensures each form instance has unique data attributes.

Current `data-header-id={header.id}` attribute on line 180 must become `data-header-id={\`${cleanId}-${header.id}\`}` to combine instance ID with header ID. This prevents header ID collisions between different form instances.

**DOM Query Updates:**

Line 130 currently uses `document.querySelector('[data-metadata="url"] input')` which queries the entire document. Replace with `containerRef.current?.querySelector(\`[data-metadata="${cleanId}"] input\`)` to query only within this component instance and target this instance's specific metadata attribute.

Line 141 currently uses `document.querySelector(\`[data-header-id="${id}"]\` input)` which queries the entire document. Replace with `containerRef.current?.querySelector(\`[data-header-id="${cleanId}-${id}"]\` input)` to query only within this component instance and target the correctly namespaced header ID.

Add null checks using optional chaining operator to handle cases where ref is not yet attached or element doesn't exist. The pattern should be `containerRef.current?.querySelector()?.focus()` with appropriate type assertions only after null checks.

**Header ID Generation Fix:**

Lines 82 and 97 currently use `Date.now().toString()` for header ID generation. This creates potential for collisions when operations happen in the same millisecond or when multiple form instances initialize simultaneously.

Replace with the established pattern from source-body-upload.tsx line 103: `\`${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}\``. This combines timestamp with random alphanumeric suffix providing nine additional characters of uniqueness.

Line 45 initializes headers array with hardcoded `id: "1"`. This means every RequestMetadataForm instance starts with the same ID. Replace with the same Date.now() plus random pattern to ensure uniqueness from initialization.

**Focus Behavior Verification:**

After implementing scoped queries and namespaced attributes, when user selects a method in the FormSelect component, the handleMethodChange function will execute setTimeout to focus the URL input. The query `containerRef.current?.querySelector(\`[data-metadata="${cleanId}"] input\`)` will now target only the URL input within the same form instance that triggered the selection, not the first form on the page.

Similarly, when user selects a header type in handleTypeChange, the query will target only the header value input within the same form instance and for the specific header ID that was changed.

### **2. Create Centralized ID Generation Utility**

**File Location**: `/utils/id-generator.ts` (new file)

**Utility Functions:**

Create `generateRuntimeId` function that takes optional string prefix parameter and returns string. Implementation combines `Date.now()` with `Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)` to create format like `1234567890123-a8c3k2m9p`. If prefix provided, prepend with hyphen separator resulting in format like `header-1234567890123-a8c3k2m9p`.

Create `generateComponentId` function that wraps React.useId() and sanitizes the result. This function must be a hook (prefix with use) because it calls React.useId(). Returns the ID with all colons replaced by empty string to make it safe for use in data attributes and CSS selectors.

**Integration Points:**

Update request-metadata.tsx to import and use `generateRuntimeId('header')` for all header ID generation instead of inline Date.now() calls. This centralizes the pattern and makes it easier to update the algorithm in the future.

Update source-body-upload.tsx to import and use `generateRuntimeId('file')` instead of inline implementation. This ensures consistency and reduces code duplication.

Any future components that need runtime IDs should use this utility instead of implementing their own ID generation logic.

**Benefits of Centralization:**

Single source of truth for ID generation algorithms. If the pattern needs to change in the future (for example, switching to crypto.randomUUID() when browser support is universal), only one file needs updating.

Consistent ID format across entire codebase makes debugging easier and patterns more predictable.

Prevents developers from using weak patterns like Date.now() alone by providing the correct implementation as the path of least resistance.

Testable and mockable ID generation for unit tests that need deterministic IDs.

### **3. LocalStorageManager Enhancement for Tab Isolation**

**File Location**: `/utils/local-storage.ts`

**Tab Instance Identification:**

Add private property `tabId` to LocalStorageManager class initialized in constructor. Generate tab ID using the same runtime ID pattern: `\`tab-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}\``.

Store tab ID in instance but not in localStorage because each tab should have its own unique identifier that doesn't persist. The tab ID is session-specific and should be regenerated every time the page loads in any tab.

**Storage Method Enhancement:**

Extend `setItem` method signature to accept optional configuration object as third parameter with properties: version (existing), tabScoped (new boolean), and any future options.

When `tabScoped` is true, modify the storage key to include tab ID: `${this.prefix}${key}_${this.tabId}`. When false, use existing behavior: `${this.prefix}${key}`.

Default `tabScoped` to false to maintain backward compatibility with all existing storage operations. Only opt-in features like form auto-save should explicitly enable tab scoping.

**Storage Retrieval Enhancement:**

Extend `getItem` method to accept same optional configuration object. When `tabScoped` is true, attempt to retrieve with tab-scoped key first. If not found, optionally fall back to non-scoped key for migration scenarios.

This fallback behavior enables graceful migration where existing stored data can be read even after switching to tab-scoped storage, preventing data loss for users with existing saved forms.

**Key Cleanup Enhancement:**

Extend `getAllKeys` method to support filtering by tab scope. Add optional parameter to return only tab-scoped keys, only non-scoped keys, or all keys (default).

This enables selective cleanup of tab-specific data when user closes tab (using beforeunload event) while preserving shared data that should persist across tabs.

Add `clearTabScoped` method that removes all keys containing the current tab ID. This provides easy cleanup mechanism when user explicitly clears their session or when implementing automatic cleanup policies.

**Migration Support:**

Add method `migrateToTabScoped` that takes a key and migrates existing non-scoped data to tab-scoped format. This helps transition existing features to use tab isolation without losing user data.

Check if non-scoped key exists, if yes, read the data, write to tab-scoped key, optionally remove non-scoped key based on configuration parameter. Return boolean indicating success.

### **4. Auto-Save Hook Tab Isolation Integration**

**File Location**: `/components/forms/blocks/auto-save-form.tsx`

**Enable Tab-Scoped Storage:**

Update all `storage.setItem` calls in useAutoSave hook to pass `{ tabScoped: true }` as third parameter. This ensures each browser tab maintains independent form drafts.

Update all `storage.getItem` calls to pass `{ tabScoped: true }` as second parameter. This retrieves only the draft specific to the current tab.

**User Experience Implications:**

With tab isolation, each browser tab gets independent form auto-save state. If user opens same form in three tabs and makes different edits in each, each tab maintains its own draft independently.

When user closes a tab, the beforeunload handler saves the final state to tab-scoped storage. This data remains available if user reopens the form in a new tab and can be offered as recovery option.

Optionally implement tab-scoped draft list UI that shows all available drafts across different tab sessions with timestamps, allowing users to choose which draft to restore.

**Cross-Tab Awareness:**

Consider adding optional notification system that detects when same form is open in multiple tabs. Use localStorage events to detect when other tabs make changes.

Display non-intrusive indicator showing "This form is also open in X other tabs" to prevent user confusion about why their changes in one tab don't appear in another.

Provide optional "sync with other tab" action that allows user to pull changes from another tab's draft if desired.

### **5. Standardize All LocalStorage Access**

**Enforcement Strategy:**

Establish rule that all direct localStorage access must be replaced with LocalStorageManager calls. No exceptions unless explicitly documented with architectural decision record.

Create ESLint rule or code review checklist to catch direct localStorage usage in pull requests. Add comments in code explaining why LocalStorageManager must be used.

**Migration Plan for Existing Code:**

**File: base-selector.tsx (line 188)**
Currently uses `localStorage.setItem(storageKey, JSON.stringify(selectedValues))` directly. Replace with `storage.setItem(storageKey, selectedValues)` which handles JSON stringification internally.

Benefit: Adds timestamp tracking, consistent error handling, and prefix namespacing to prevent key collisions with other applications or browser extensions.

**File: use-table-state.ts (lines 38, 65)**
Currently uses `localStorage.getItem(\`table-state-${tableId}\`)` and corresponding setItem. Replace with `storage.getItem(\`table-state-${tableId}\`)` and `storage.setItem(\`table-state-${tableId}\`, state)`.

Benefit: Adds error handling so table state failures don't crash the component. Adds prefix to prevent collisions. Enables future version migrations if table state structure changes.

**File: recent-items.ts (lines 14, 34)**
Currently uses direct localStorage with hardcoded `algops_recent_items` key. Replace with `storage.getItem('recent_items')` and `storage.setItem('recent_items', items)` where the manager handles prefix automatically.

Benefit: Removes duplicate prefix logic. Centralizes error handling. Makes it possible to migrate recent items structure in future using version parameter.

**Verification:**

After migration, search entire codebase for `localStorage.` pattern outside of LocalStorageManager implementation file. Should find zero results in application code.

Test each migrated component to verify functionality remains identical. Pay special attention to error scenarios where localStorage might fail or be disabled.

### **6. Parent Form Component Integration**

**Files Affected**: 
- `/components/forms/run-request-form.tsx`
- `/components/forms/delivery-form.tsx`
- `/components/forms/status-check-form.tsx`

**Instance ID Prop Addition:**

Each parent form component should optionally accept `instanceId` prop of type string. This prop is passed through to RequestMetadataForm component.

When forms are used in isolation (one per page), no instanceId prop is needed. React.useId() in RequestMetadataForm will handle it automatically.

When forms are displayed together (like in forms showcase page), the showcase page can pass explicit instance IDs like `instanceId="run-request"`, `instanceId="delivery"`, `instanceId="status-check"` to ensure predictable and debuggable IDs.

**Auto-Save Integration:**

Each parent form that uses auto-save should specify unique formId that makes sense in context. For example, RunRequestForm could use formId based on source ID if editing specific source: `form_run_request_${sourceId}`.

When displaying multiple forms on showcase page, use descriptive formIds like `form_showcase_run_request`, `form_showcase_delivery`, etc. to prevent confusion in localStorage.

**Testing Multiple Forms:**

Forms showcase page at `/app/components-showcase/forms/page.tsx` currently displays RunRequestForm, DeliveryForm, StatusCheckForm, and SourceRequestResponseAccordion components all on same page.

After implementing isolation fixes, test this page specifically by:
- Selecting method in first form, verify focus goes to first form's URL input
- Selecting method in second form, verify focus goes to second form's URL input
- Selecting method in third form, verify focus goes to third form's URL input
- Adding header in first form, verify it only affects first form
- Adding header in second form, verify it only affects second form
- Verifying each form maintains independent state

**Multi-Tab Testing:**

Open forms showcase page in two browser tabs. Make different edits to the RunRequestForm in each tab. Verify that auto-save in each tab maintains separate drafts without conflict.

Open same source edit page in multiple tabs. Make changes in each tab independently. Verify each tab's auto-save works correctly and doesn't interfere with other tabs.

### **7. Data Attribute and CSS Selector Standards**

**Naming Convention:**

All data attributes used for component instance identification must follow pattern: `data-{component-name}={instanceId}` where component-name is kebab-case and instanceId is the sanitized React.useId() result.

All data attributes used for element identification within components must follow pattern: `data-{element-type}-{element-id}={compositeId}` where compositeId combines instance ID and element ID like `${instanceId}-${elementId}`.

**querySelector Best Practices:**

Never use `document.querySelector()` or `document.querySelectorAll()` in component code. Always use component-scoped ref-based queries.

Pattern for querying own elements: `containerRef.current?.querySelector('[data-attribute="value"]')`

Pattern for querying child component elements: `containerRef.current?.querySelector('[data-component] [data-element]')`

Always use optional chaining when querying to handle cases where ref is not mounted or element doesn't exist yet.

**CSS Selector Naming:**

When styling based on data attributes, use attribute selectors: `[data-metadata="url"]` for exact match or `[data-metadata*="url"]` for partial match.

When combining instance and element IDs, use partial match selectors: `[data-header-id*="${headerId}"]` will match `${instanceId}-${headerId}`.

Avoid using IDs (`#`) for styling component elements. Use data attributes or classes instead. IDs must be globally unique which conflicts with reusable components.

### **8. Event System Integration**

**LocalStorage Change Events:**

When LocalStorageManager performs setItem, removeItem, or clear operations, dispatch custom event `algopsStorageChange` with detail object containing: key, operation (set/remove/clear), tabId, timestamp.

Components can listen for these events to react to storage changes: `window.addEventListener('algopsStorageChange', handleStorageChange)`

This enables cross-component reactivity and real-time updates when storage changes occur.

**Cross-Tab Communication:**

Browser's native storage event fires when localStorage changes in other tabs. LocalStorageManager should listen for storage events and re-dispatch as `algopsStorageChange` events with additional metadata.

This enables components to detect when other tabs modify shared storage and optionally sync or show notifications.

For tab-scoped storage, ignore storage events that don't match current tab ID to prevent unnecessary processing.

**Form-Specific Events:**

When form auto-save triggers, dispatch `algopsFormAutoSaved` event with formId and tabId in detail. Components can show save indicators or sync status based on these events.

When form draft is loaded from storage, dispatch `algopsFormDraftLoaded` event. This enables analytics tracking or user notifications about recovered drafts.

### **9. Backward Compatibility and Migration**

**Existing Data Preservation:**

Before implementing tab isolation for auto-save, check if non-scoped form data exists in localStorage. If found, migrate to tab-scoped format or offer user choice to restore.

Display one-time migration notification explaining that forms now save separately per tab and any existing saved drafts have been preserved in current tab.

**Version Tracking:**

Use LocalStorageManager's version parameter to mark storage structure versions. Current implementation should be version "2.0" indicating second generation with tab support.

When reading old version data, automatically migrate to new structure. Store version number with data to enable future migrations.

**Rollback Capability:**

Maintain ability to rollback to non-scoped storage if tab isolation causes issues. Provide admin setting or feature flag to disable tab scoping if needed.

If rollback occurs, merge tab-scoped drafts into single non-scoped draft by timestamp (most recent wins) to prevent data loss.

### **10. Performance Optimization**

**Lazy Initialization:**

Don't query localStorage on every component render. Initialize storage data in useEffect with empty dependency array to run once on mount.

Cache storage reads in component state to avoid repeated localStorage access. Only re-read when storage change events indicate data was modified.

**Debounced Saves:**

Auto-save should debounce storage writes to prevent excessive localStorage operations. Current 5-second interval is reasonable but ensure it uses debouncing not throttling.

Debouncing means resetting timer on each change, so rapid typing results in single save 5 seconds after user stops typing. This is more efficient than saving every 5 seconds regardless of activity.

**Batch Operations:**

When saving multiple related items (like form metadata, form data, and form validation state), use single storage operation with combined object rather than three separate operations.

This reduces localStorage access overhead and ensures atomic updates where all related data saves together or fails together.

**Storage Size Monitoring:**

Implement periodic check of localStorage usage to warn users before hitting quota limits. Most browsers provide 5-10MB localStorage quota.

Calculate approximate size of stored data by JSON stringifying and checking byte length. Show warning when usage exceeds 80% of estimated quota.

Provide storage management UI allowing users to clear old drafts, exported data, or cached files to free up space.

### **11. Testing Strategy**

**Unit Tests for ID Generation:**

Test generateRuntimeId produces unique IDs across multiple rapid calls. Test with loop of 1000 calls ensuring no duplicates.

Test generateRuntimeId with prefix produces correct format: `prefix-timestamp-randomstring`.

Test that generated IDs are valid for use in data attributes and CSS selectors (no special characters that need escaping).

**Component Isolation Tests:**

Mount multiple RequestMetadataForm instances in test environment. Verify each has unique instanceId.

Simulate user interaction in one instance (selecting method) and verify focus changes only affect that instance's elements, not other instances.

Test data attribute values are unique across instances by querying rendered DOM for duplicate attribute values.

**LocalStorage Manager Tests:**

Test tab-scoped setItem and getItem correctly add and retrieve data with tab ID in key.

Test non-scoped operations remain unchanged for backward compatibility.

Test getAllKeys correctly filters tab-scoped vs non-scoped keys.

Test clearTabScoped removes only current tab's data, leaving other tabs' data and shared data intact.

**Integration Tests:**

Test forms showcase page with multiple forms ensuring each operates independently.

Test multi-tab scenario where same form is open in multiple tabs with different drafts.

Test auto-save in one tab doesn't interfere with auto-save in another tab.

Test migration from old non-scoped storage to new tab-scoped storage preserves data.

**Browser Compatibility:**

Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure localStorage behavior is consistent.

Test in private/incognito mode where localStorage might behave differently.

Test with localStorage disabled (some browsers allow this) and verify graceful degradation.

Test with localStorage quota exceeded and verify appropriate error handling and user feedback.
